GoogleDocs2LaTeX
Copyright (c) 2010 Philip Chimento

This program downloads word-processor content from your Google Docs account and
translates it semantically into LaTeX. It is meant for scientists (primarily me)
who would rather write their papers in an online word processor so they are
accessible from everywhere, but would rather format them in LaTeX.

EASY-TO-READ TERMS OF USE
-------------------------
You are welcome to hack on this project, as long as I can decide when the first 
public release is. After that it becomes normal open source software. (See the
file `COPYING' for the full terms of use.)
